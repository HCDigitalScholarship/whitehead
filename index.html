								</div>
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>John Cunningham Whitehead (1922 – 2015) dedicated his life to the betterment of others. He was an agent of privilege with the spirit of an ally whose witness to the injustice, fear and segregation of others informed his character. Whitehead left an impressive legacy in allyship across professional fields and his story resonates with those committed to creating communities of mutual trust and respect. Whitehead’s hardworking attitude and moral drive, shaped by his family’s values and Haverford education, helped form the man that would become an ally with a strong sense of social responsibility.

							<h2>Entreprenurial Innovation</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Whitehead worked in the world of finance for the majority of his professional career, when investment banking firms were just starting to operate internationally. He successfully developed the program for Goldman, Sachs & Co, working with people from many different industries and parts of the world. His sense of allyship grew through his passion to help solidify the Goldman, Sachs & Co. standards, making them properly adapt to a global context. He helped craft optimal customer service policies and enhanced company morale, eventually becoming partner in the late 1950’s. Whitehead promoted unity at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and set common goals that established solidarity as the best practice for investing. He became passionate about projects related to humanitarian service and the arts, and used his entrepreneurial skills to ensure their success during the latter part of his life. </p>

							<h2>Public Service</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Although Whitehead dedicated most of his professional career to the private sector, his personal investments were always aimed at helping others through public service. This commitment began at a young age as a Boy Scout and became serious when he graduated a semester early from Haverford College to serve in the Navy during World War II. After his war service Whitehead promoted social justice through platforms with greater public outreach. While working in business he independently helped philanthropic organizations  and  became a trustworthy ally that was solicited to work in similar projects later on. He worked for the State Department during the Reagan Era and continued to work in service after 9/11 through the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC).

							<h2>Philanthropic Endeavors</h2>
						</header>
						<p> Whitehead began his involvement with NGO’s while still working at Goldman, Sachs & Co. He came across an opportunity to help refugees through the International Rescue Committee in 1956 and decided to lead the organization as its treasurer and chairman after that. Philanthropy was a flexible investment for Whitehead because it had diverse platforms with multiple causes to choose from. He supported a number of organizations and kept himself busy helping these systems gain structure. Whitehead also remained intellectually curious and eager to learn, and he began art collecting in the late 1970’s. Philanthropy and art shifted from being Whitehead's pastimes, to his most interesting priorities. </p>

							<h2>Early Life & Haverford College</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Whitehead learned about the value of hard work at a young age. He was raised during the stressful climate of the Great Depression and grew up with certain struggles due to financial setbacks. His first experiences in service happened through his town’s local Boy Scouts chapter. Later on as a Haverford student, he engaged in extracurricular activities that helped him develop his character as a team player. </p>
