								<h3> Early Life </h3>
								<p>Before helping so many people and working across a number of fields and disciplines, Whitehead experienced financial hardship at a young age. The son of Eugene Whitehead and Winifred Kaufmann, John was born on April 2nd, 1922 in Illinois, and was raised in Montclair, New Jersey. Whitehead was first exposed to the hardships of the economy at the age of seven, with the stock market crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. Whitehead saw his father lose his job and his family struggle to make ends meet. He searched for meaningful pastimes and got involved in his town’s local Boy Scouts chapter, where he was first exposed to leadership practices and team building. Whitehead discovered a sense of purpose through the Boy Scouts and he began to work for others as Assistant Camp Director at Camp Glen Gray in Oakland. </p>
                                
<h4> Haverford College </h4>
                                <p>After Montclair, Whitehead completed his undergraduate education at Haverford College. He enrolled in the fall of 1939 with an intended Chemistry major and ended up doing Economics, which was a good fit for his later work in naval accounting and then investment banking at Goldman, Sachs & Co. Although Whitehead was a diligent academic, he excelled more in extracurricular activities and organizations. He sang in the glee club, played JV baseball and basketball, wrote for the college newspaper, was a high jumper on the track team, all while working at the library. In addition to playing sports, he also helped coordinate many of them by directing the Intramural Athletics Club. Whitehead participated in the International Relations Club and he presided over the Students’ Council during his senior year. His proudest achievement during college was being elected permanent class president during his senior year. His classmates thought Whitehead ought to be representative of a larger group, and he continued to work in this manner throughout his life.</p>

<p>The Quaker culture at Haverford was split during those years in War. Some students rejected the violence in protest and others, like Whitehead, sought involvement through service. The Navy’s Supply Corps plan was designed to allow students in higher education to graduate earlier from school to service the War. Instead of completing his undergraduate education in the expected four years, Whitehead and many of his classmates completed a summer semester and were able to graduate early in January of 1943. Whitehead attributed a lot of his successes to the College and he saw the experience as formative of his altruistic character. His liberal arts education served as a reminder that he could have an interdisciplinary career that was not limited in its scope.
