								<h3> The Navy, The State Department and 9/11</h3>
								<p>World War II highly impacted Haverford College’s Quaker outlook on peace and community. Even student publications, like the Haverford News, became platforms for war propaganda and many students were affected by the drafting process. The 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks intensified the political climate around anti-war activism everywhere in the US, and Whitehead gained perspective on the international struggles that were happening beyond Lancaster Avenue. </p>

<p>As a college student, Whitehead felt like his role in the World War II efforts had been passive. He was benefiting from higher education while soldiers and civilians were dying, and an urge to defend others outside of his community became a priority. Whitehead left Haverford College in 1943 and  joined the US Navy, where he served as disbursing and assistant supply officer for the U.S.S. Thomas Jefferson. He mainly managed money and supplies for the crew, but he also participated in major projects like ‘Operation Overlord,’ the codename for the Normandy Invasion of  June 6, 1944 .These experiences made Whitehead consider the implications of his actions within a more global context. </p>

<p>After Normandy, Whitehead was relocated to the Pacific, where he assisted in a number of operations, including transporting US troops to Iwo Jima and then Okinawa in 1945. In Whitehead's opinion, fighting against the Japanese was more difficult because they were willing to sacrifice themselves in bomb-plane strikes. Whitehead recalled “fear being the constant companion.” Although these strategies predate the terrorism culture of the twenty first century, they remained in Whitehead’s consciousness and resurfaced during his work for Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks.  </p>

<p>The Navy exposed Whitehead to powerful realities of hate and injustice, and after World War II, he understood and sympathized more with issues of mass immigration, death, loss, and the need for international diplomacy. Although he worked for the private sector during the majority of his professional career at Goldman, Sachs & Co. this did not distance him from geopolitical issues that concerned the public sector. Instead, through international business work in investment banking, Whitehead learned more about developing economies without access to the free market.</p>

<p>Whitehead had also been a member of the Council on Foreign Relations while he worked at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and through that outlet he became good friends with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Whitehead learned a lot about the dynamics of practicing diplomacy through that friendship with Kissinger, and his awareness for sociopolitical issues prepared him for an unexpected job offer. </p>

<p>US Secretary of State, George Shultz, knew Whitehead from when Shultz worked as Secretary of the Treasury in the 1970’s. Shultz offered Whitehead the opportunity to become Deputy Secretary of State for the Reagan administration because the government was looking at destabilizing soviet satellite countries in the Eastern block. Whitehead’s professional experience in international economic development helped him become Deputy Secretary of State  in October of 1985. </p>

<p>While at Washington, Whitehead saw the Soviet’s imposition of communism on their satellite states as an oppressive tactic that limited these countries’ potential for economic development. He thought every country should move towards global economic integration that would connect, rather than ostracize countries in the global market. His geopolitical aim during his term was to help these nations break loose from Soviet control by formalizing a sustainable framework for autonomy through the promotion of capitalism. As Deputy Secretary of State, Whitehead made much diplomatic progress the countries of Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria by meeting with state officials and building meaningful relationships with their representatives. </p>

<p>In Poland for example, Whitehead traveled for approximately three weeks between January and February of 1987 to discuss issues relating to the imposition of US sanctions. Military communist leader of Poland, Wojciech Jaruzelski, imposed martial law on December 13, 1981. As a result, the US began a systematic implementation of economic sanctions that would destroy the authoritarian government, and Whitehead had to oversee a lot of these negotiations. Whitehead was able to convince Jaruzelski to stop issuing political arrests and he then convinced the rest of the reagan administration to lift the ban based on the agreement. This was a major human rights negotiation agreement as a result of US foreign policy, and Whitehead was an agent in making it happen. </p>

<p>Whitehead was also concerned with domestic human rights issues. By 1986, Shultz and Whitehead were working on creating an internship program that would expand government involvement for women and minorities. Shultz thought that is was of “fundamental importance that the Foreign Service truly represent the cultural and ethnic diversity of our own society”, and he indicated that the lack of such balanced representation was “a foreign policy problem which affects our image as a nation and as a leader of the free world.” Whitehead quickly learned that most of these inclusion efforts focused less on the cause and more on elevating the government’s image in relation to the cause. </p>

<p>Whitehead learned about contradictions in diplomatic practice and he learned a great deal about the effects of having a collective identity. It was frustrating for Whitehead because he was trying to breach gaps between racial groups, meanwhile President Reagan had a bit of a problematic stance on Apartheid that sent out a different message on the government's engagement with people of color abroad. During 1983, the Apartheid system that racially segregated people in South Africa was under attack by the international community, and pressure to collapse the system was happening in the form of economic sanctions. Many disagree on whether or not this was the appropriate course of action, but it was the UN’s recommendation and President Reagan's choice to veto the sanctions consequently linked him to pro-apartheid ideals. </p>

<p>Regardless of that, Whitehead continued to work on projects he felt passionate about and in 1985, he submitted a proposal with 32 recommendations for Shultz to increase the opportunities of black people in the Foreign Service. Some of Whitehead’s recommendations included targeting colleges and universities who had historically committed to the education of minority groups, and providing them with greater access to the specific information on how to apply for the Foreign Service exam. He also suggested the assignment of more black officers to senior (and visible) role model positions in the government, as well as the inclusion of more people of color on the Board of Examiners Panels.</p>

<p>President Reagan did recognize Whitehead’s commitment to these civil rights issues, and  in 1989, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal. This recognition is the second highest civilian award in the US,  and it is awarded to someone who has done significant work for citizens of the US. Whitehead felt very passionate about his work in diplomacy, but he didn’t feel the need to continue to pursue other political positions in D.C. after Reagan's term because he had discovered other avenues for change. He wanted to dedicate his full attention to nonprofit organizations that lacked federal financial support. The NGO’s and nonprofits Whitehead worked for were in desperate need of vocal allies, and he knew he could gather more support in a nonpartisan environment rather than in a political one.</p> 

<p>Whitehead’s public service role evolved greatly after the State Department. He transitioned from being Deputy Secretary of State during the Cold War and Reagan-Era, and he kept working with NGO’s and nonprofits (see Philanthropy section). Whitehead was again recruited for government service after the 9/11 attacks took place at the World Trade Center in New York. This event was evidently a grave shift in international foreign policy issues, and it affected and continues to impact the lives of people all over the world. After the attacks the people of lower Manhattan were physically unable to continue with their daily routines because of the high destruction levels in the area.</p> 

<p>There are current estimates that place the financial burden of 9/11 at an overwhelming three trillion dollars. Toll and physical damage alone estimated at around $55 billion of that total. Mayor-elect Michael Bloomberg and Governor George Pataki of New York focused on creating a system that would oversee transportation, construction, and other infrastructure projects, as well as keeping incentives for people to reside and do business throughout in the area. They devised the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) as the agent of that system, and Whitehead was selected as its leader.</p> 

<p>He had previously attempted to retire and similar opportunities had come up. Nevertheless, Whitehead became chairman at age 79 and he helped create programs that would maintain a significant residential and commercial presence in the area, including the affordable housing initiative and the community enhancement fund. Whitehead also helped open up schools in the area and even began the procedures for the construction of the memorial. He also arranged a ferry system for commuters from New Jersey who were struggling to get into the city due to the damaged railroad systems after the attacks. Whitehead’ age did not allow him to work on the project as comprehensively as he would have liked to, but he was a key figure who pioneered the program. Whitehead’s experiences in public service developed his altruistic character. He became resourceful and ambitious, and realized that if couldn’t help the government in assisting causes, he had to help pilot NGO’s that could. This is why philanthropy ultimately paved Whitehead's pathway through allyship, and this will be explored further in the following section.</p>
