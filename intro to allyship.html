								<h3>How Was John Whitehead an Ally?</h3>
				

<p>John Cunningham Whitehead (1922 – 2015) dedicated his life to bettering the lives of others. He was an agent of privilege with the spirit of an ally, something he probably wouldn't have called himself. Current anti-oppression language refers to allies as people who use their identities to help empower the lives of those who cannot do it alone. Terms like privilege, agency and allyship are used today to help educate on best practices for meaningful activism. Our discourse on race has faltered, and become increasingly polarized. The Black Lives Matter movement is condemned even as White Supremacy makes a public comeback.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, John Whitehead surveyed a not so different world. In his world, subordinate cultures were under constant threat. He witnessed many moments characterized by chaos and fear, where college students were either protesting the war in Vietnam or dying in it. Segregation defined American society, and even water fountains had an opinion about the color of one’s skin. Today, countless individuals in countries like the United States still face institutional injustice and systematic prejudice. Whitehead left an impressive legacy as an ally across professional fields and his story resonates with current commitments toward creating communities of mutual trust and respect. Whether it was in public service, philanthropy, or at Haverford College, Whitehead’s hardworking attitude and moral drive helped him become an ally with a strong sense of social responsibility.</p>

<p>*Note to reader: The terms below have been devised by a team of Swarthmore Students and they are meant to be used as an evolving Trico Guide to understanding issues that make use of anti-oppression language. 

Allyship (“ally work”): The process of using a privileged identity to confront systems of injustice and try to deconstruct them at an institutional level. 
Privilege: A set of unearned benefits that come with an identity you hold (ex. gender, race, age, class, etc.)
Agent/Privileged/Dominant Group: A social group that is positively valued, considered to be superior or “normal,” and has access to social power. 
Social Power: Access to resources that enhance one’s chances of getting what one needs or influencing others in order to lead a comfortable, productive and safe life.
Target/Oppressed/Subordinate Group: A social group that is negatively valued, considered to be inferior, deviant or dependent, and has limited access to social power.
Institutional Oppression: The network of institutional structures, policies and practices that create advantages and benefits for dominant group members and discrimination, oppression, and disadvantages for subordinated group members. The advantages for dominant group members are often invisible to them or are considered entitlements or rights available to everyone as opposed to unearned privileges awarded to only some individuals or groups. Examples of “institutions” may include: government, education, housing, media, business, health care, criminal justice, employment, labor, politics, religious organizations, etc.
Social Justice: A vision of society in which the distribution of resources is equitable and all members are physically and psychologically safe and secure. It involves social actors who have a sense of their own agency as well as a sense of social responsibility toward and with others, their society, and the world.
