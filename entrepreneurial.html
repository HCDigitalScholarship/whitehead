								<h3>Harvard Business School (HBS) and Goldman, Sachs & Co.</h3>
								<p>Whitehead was a man of many careers and as a result, he had a diverse network of contacts that exposed him to projects and experiences that stimulated his feelings for social justice. His first career was in the Navy service during World War II and then he ventured into business and investment banking. When he returned from the War in 1945, he assisted the Navy in an accounting program at the Harvard Business School (HBS). He became an instructor for a while until the end of his service, and developed relationships with faculty members that exposed him to a number of potential careers in the world of finance. Whitehead enrolled at the HBS and stayed in Cambridge for two years, until he earned his MBA in 1947. </p> 
								
								
<p> Later in October of that year, Whitehead joined Goldman, Sachs & Co. At that time, the firm had little personnel and outreach, and it was not the powerful, multinational company we think of today. Whitehead did a lot of work at Goldman, Sachs & Co. with an International Advisory Committee that began expanding investment divisions all throughout the US and at the international level. This kind of work was important in Whitehead’s development as an ally because it gave him the necessary skills for creating relationships with clients abroad, and an awareness for economic issues and needs in countries outside of the United States. Whitehead helped transform Goldman, Sachs & Co. and was made partner at the age of 34 in 1956. </p>


<p> As partner, he helped design a New Business department that went on to become the Investment Banking Services, or IBS program, that the firm is known for today. Whitehead also created the company's ‘Business Principles,’ a tangible mission statement focused on employee work ethic and company morale. This shows how Whitehead was committed to not only the company’s financial success, but also to the motivations and progress of the people who were working for it. He saw it as his biggest contribution to the company and these principles are still used by Goldman Sachs today. </p>

<p> By 1976 Whitehead went from being partner to co-chairman with John Weinberg, a work colleague and friend. They opted for a paired leadership because as a collaborative team, they could execute business strategies more efficiently. Whitehead had been in the field for a long time and his commitment and dedication to the company and its clients made him a very wealthy man. He realized he wanted to start investing that wealth in projects and issues he felt passionate about. He saw a lot of tragedies unravel during the War and he wanted to help prevent future international conflicts by giving back to committed organizations. After a total of 38 years, Whitehead left Goldman, Sachs & Co. in 1985 with plans of retiring.</p>
