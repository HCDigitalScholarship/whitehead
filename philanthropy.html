								<h3>Dolore Amet Consequat</h3>
								<p>Whitehead was a very wealthy investor by the mid 1950’s, but he felt detached from the lavish millionaire lifestyle that many around him wanted to pursue. He learned a lot about the Hungarian freedom fighters while on a trip to Vienna in the fall of 1956, and after the trip, he became interested in the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and their efforts to support war refugees after WWII. While still at Goldman, Whitehead used his investment advising skills and became the IRC’s treasurer and chairman, helping it manage finances and aiding people from Laos, Azerbaijan, Pakistan and many other places around the world. Whitehead became an active ally through philanthropy, and he helped pioneer and support many organizations that fought for human rights issues. </p>

<p>While working at the State Department, Whitehead got involved in multiple projects through the U.N., like being chairman of the United Nations Association for 10 years. He also served as chairman of smaller and upcoming organizations like the International House, a student cultural program, and the Asia Society, a nonprofit aimed at improving American understandings of Asian culture, politics and economics. Whitehead also helped more renowned organizations like the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Getty Museum in LA, the Brookings Institute and the National Gallery in Washington D.C.</p> 

<p>In addition to sociocultural initiatives, Whitehead also focused his efforts on education. While on Harvard’s Board of Overseers, he helped set up a social enterprise program at the HBS aimed at teaching students about managing nonprofits. Through Haverford’s Board of Managers, he helped the college move towards co-education, integrating women into the small liberal arts learning community. Whitehead was also concerned with environmental initiatives and he worked closely with organizations like the Nature Conservancy, Outward Bound, and the New York Boy Scouts.</p> 

<p>Whitehead specifically influenced a local Boy Scouts policy that was very controversial in the late 1990’s. The Boy Scouts of America had traditionally been very religious and it had a history of discrimination against gay scouts.  Although Whitehead was not able to change the national Boy Scout policy in his lifetime, he did change the New York Council’s policy, and he would be happy to know that on July 27, 2015, the policy changed when the National Executive Board voted to lift the organization's ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p> 

<p>Whitehead’s range of work in nonprofit outreach demonstrate his commitment towards empowering groups who suffered from injustice due to underrepresentation and lack of resources. As a collective process, allyship depends on others’ willingness to engage with and promote social justice, and Whitehead’s hobby in philanthropy precisely focused on both helping people in need, and informing those who could help.</p> 

<p>In the 1970’s, Whitehead developed another pastime in art collecting. He was always excited to find new ways of understanding the world and learning about culture, and he liked the critical thinking skills that came with collecting and responding to aesthetic emotions. His involvement in the industry began when he attended a Sotheby’s art auction while vacationing in London in 1978. There, he purchased an acclaimed Modigliani drawing, an art piece from the early 20th century. He found himself reading about his new acquisition and wanting to learn more about 19th and 20th century art. Achim Moeller, a German art dealer, later helped Whitehead expand his collection, which included impressive works from Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Miró, and many other renowned artists.</p> 

<p>Whitehead's collection also had works that resonated with his public service initiatives in the Navy and IRC. In the early 1940’s, Nazi Germany controlled a great deal of continental Europe and millions were fleeing the area in search for safety. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) supported this exodus with humanitarian aid and other resources. Among the refugees were a number of artists who settled in New York. 

<p>In 1971, ‘Flight’, a print series of eleven original lithographs and one original serigraph, was published to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the IRC’s rescue operation in Europe. Refugee artists made the images in the series, which capture the terrors and anxieties of war. Whitehead found solidarity in art because it connected him to other people’s tastes, experiences, and emotions. As an art collector, Whitehead was also able to keep his intellectual drive in motion by learning about things that were outside of his professional comfort zone. </p>
