										<h2>How did Whitehead develop a sense of Allyship?</h2>
				
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>John Cunningham Whitehead (1922 – 2015) dedicated his life to bettering the ones of others. He was a successful leader in many ways, and in doing so, he discovered the power of allyship and his role as an agent of privilege. Whether it was in public service, entrepreneurial innovation, philanthropy, or at Haverford College, Whitehead’s hardworking attitude and moral drive helped him develop a strong sense of social responsibility. </p>
							
								</div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>He experienced many moments that were characterized by fear and segregation, where college students were either protesting War or dying in it, and water fountains had an opinion about the color of your skin. Whitehead’s initiative eventually made him become the kind of leader he thought was lacking in many social spheres: one who uses his identity to destroy unjust systems and empower the lives of others who can’t do it alone. Whitehead discovered the process of allyship in subtle ways and in traditional environments that were resistant to change.</p>

							<h2>Entreprenurial Innovation</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Whitehead was a man of many careers and as a result, he had a diverse network of contacts that exposed him to projects and experiences that stimulated his feelings for social justice. His first career was in the Navy service during World War II and then he ventured into business and investment banking. When he returned from the War in 1945, he assisted the Navy in an accounting program at the Harvard Business School (HBS). He became an instructor for a while until the end of his service, and developed relationships with faculty members that exposed him to a number of potential careers in the world of finance...</p>

							<h2>Public Service</h2>
						</header>
						<p>World War II highly impacted Haverford College’s Quaker outlook on peace and community. Even student publications, like the Haverford News, became platforms for war propaganda and many students were affected by the drafting process. The 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks intensified the political climate around anti-war activism everywhere in the US, and Whitehead gained perspective on the international struggles that were happening beyond Lancaster Avenue...</p>

							<h2>Philanthropic Endeavors</h2>

						<p> Whitehead was a very wealthy investor by the mid 1950’s, but he felt detached from the lavish millionaire lifestyle that many around him wanted to pursue. He learned a lot about the Hungarian freedom fighters while on a trip to Vienna in the fall of 1956, and after the trip, he became interested in the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and their efforts to support war refugees after WWII...</p>

							<h2>Early Life & Haverford College</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Before helping so many people and working across a number of fields and disciplines, Whitehead experienced financial setbacks and Quakerism at a young age. The son of Eugene Whitehead and Winifred Kaufmann, Whitehead was born on April 2nd, 1922 in Illinois, and was raised in Montclair, New Jersey. Whitehead was first exposed to the hardships of the economy at the age of seven, when the stock market crashed in 1929 and later developed into the Great Depression...</p>
