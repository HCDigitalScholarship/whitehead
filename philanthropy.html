                                <p>John Whitehead 43 w Achim Moeller P'02 and Johns art dealer</p>
                                
								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>Whitehead was a very wealthy investor by the mid 1950s but felt detached from the lavish millionaire lifestyle that many felt he should pursue. He learned a lot about the Hungarian freedom fighters while on a trip to Vienna in the fall of 1956, and after the trip, he became interested in supporting the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and their World War II efforts with refugees. While still working at Goldman, Sachs & Co. Whitehead also became the IRC’s treasurer and chairman, helping it manage finances and aiding people from Laos, Azerbaijan, Pakistan and many other places around the world. Whitehead was the initial support system for many of these human rights organizations and he became an ally to them in his management role. His range in nonprofit work demonstrates a strong commitment towards empowering subordinate  groups suffering injustice due to underrepresentation and lack of resources. </p>
                                
                                <h4>Projects Through the State Department</h4>
<p>As a collective process, allyship depends on others’ willingness to engage with and promote social justice. Whitehead’s philanthropic efforts would often overlap with his business and service work because he was a dynamic multitasker when it came to project management. While working at the State Department, Whitehead became chairman of the United Nations Association for 10 years and made an effort to improve relationships between the US and the UN. In addition to sociocultural initiatives, he focused on education to empower more people through philanthropy. While on Harvard’s Board of Overseers, he helped set up a social enterprise program at the Business School aimed at teaching students about managing nonprofits. Through Haverford’s Board of Managers, he helped the College move towards co-education, integrating women into the small liberal arts learning community. 
</p>

<p>Whitehead also worked closely with environmental initiatives like the New York Boy Scouts. He specifically influenced a local policy that was very controversial in the late 1990s. The Boy Scouts of America had traditionally been religious and the organization had a history of discrimination against gay scouts.  Whitehead was a former scout himself and invested in legal resources to help fight these discriminatory practices in the state of New York. Although Whitehead was not able to change the national scouting policy in his lifetime, he was able to help change the New York Council’s policy. He would be happy to know that on July 27, 2015, a few months after his passing, the National Executive Board of the The Boy Scouts of America voted to lift the ban everywhere based on sexual orientation. </p> 

<p>In addition to sociocultural initiatives, Whitehead also focused his efforts on education. While on Harvard’s Board of Overseers, he helped set up a social enterprise program at the HBS aimed at teaching students about managing nonprofits. Through Haverford’s Board of Managers, he helped the college move towards co-education, integrating women into the small liberal arts learning community. Whitehead was also concerned with environmental initiatives and he worked closely with organizations like the Nature Conservancy, Outward Bound, and the New York Boy Scouts.</p>

<h5>Lessons in Art Collecting</h5>
<p>In the 1970’s, Whitehead developed important skills in art collecting. He was always excited to find new ways of understanding the world and learning more about different cultures. For Whitehead, it was productive to continually exercise certain critical thinking skills that came with collecting and responding to aesthetic emotions. His involvement in the art industry began when he attended a Sotheby’s auction while vacationing in London in 1978. There, he purchased an acclaimed Modigliani drawing, an art piece from the early 20th century. He found himself reading about his new acquisition and wanting to learn more about 19th and 20th century art. Achim Moeller, a German art dealer, later helped Whitehead expand his collection, which included impressive works from Monet, Renoir, Miró, and many other renowned artists. </p>

<p>Whitehead's collection had works that reflected his public service initiatives in the Navy and IRC. In the early 1940’s, Nazi Germany controlled a great deal of continental Europe and millions were fleeing the area in search for safety. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) supported this exodus with humanitarian aid and other resources. Among the refugees were a number of artists who settled in New York. In 1971, ‘Flight’, a print series of eleven original lithographs and one original serigraph, was published to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the IRC’s rescue operation in Europe. Refugee artists made the images in the series, which capture World War II's apprehensive climate of fear and trauma. Whitehead found solidarity in art because it connected him to other people’s tastes, experiences, and emotions. As an art collector, Whitehead was also able to keep his intellectual drive in motion by learning about things that were outside of his professional comfort zone.
