								<h3> Introduction </h3>
								<p>World War II impacted the Quaker culture at Haverford College, and campus sentiments on peace and community. Even student publications, like the Haverford News, became platforms for war propaganda and many students were affected by the drafting process. While Whitehead was an undergraduate student in the early 1940’s, he gained serious interest in professional work that would help others. The 1941 Pearl Harbor attack intensified the political climate surrounding anti-war activism everywhere in the US, even as it provided Whitehead more perspective on the international struggles happening beyond Lancaster Avenue. </p>

<h4> World War II and The Navy</h4>
<p>As a college student, Whitehead felt that his role in the war effort had been passive. He was benefiting from higher education while soldiers and civilians were dying, and an urge to defend others outside of his community became a priority. Whitehead left Haverford College in 1943 to  join the US Navy, where he served as disbursing and assistant supply officer onboard the U.S.S. Thomas Jefferson. He primary duty was money and supplies management for the crew, a responsibility that increased his awareness for the necessity of trust and support for others. Whitehead’s formative war experiences included participation in ‘Operation Overlord,’ the codename for the Normandy Invasion of  June 6, 1944.
</p>

<p>Whitehead’s war experiences shaped his considerations of the implications of his actions within a global context. The Navy exposed Whitehead to powerful realities of hate and injustice, and after his World War II service, he understood and sympathized more with issues of mass immigration, death, loss, and the need for international diplomacy. Whitehead worked in the private sector during the majority of his professional career as a businessman at Goldman, Sachs & Co., but this did not distance him from larger geopolitical issues. Through his work in investment banking, Whitehead increased his perspective on developing economies and their potential for growth. </p>

<h5> The State Department </h5>                
<p>Whitehead had been a member of the Council on Foreign Relations while still working at Goldman, Sachs & Co. As a nonprofit, the Council focuses on investing time and resources in research related to US foreign policy and international affairs. Through that outlet, Whitehead also became good friends with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. During this time, Whitehead learned a lot about the dynamics of international diplomacy, and his awareness for sociopolitical issues became more practical. US Secretary of State George Shultz knew Whitehead from Shultz’s time working as Secretary of the Treasury from 1972 to 1974. After Whitehead retired from Goldman, Sachs & Co. Shultz offered him the opportunity to become his Deputy Secretary of State in Reagan’s administration starting on October of 1985.</p>

<h6>International Diplomacy</h6>
<p>The US geopolitical focus during the Cold War was to help Soviet satellite states formalize sustainable frameworks for autonomy so that they would begin to destabilize communism near the USSR. As Deputy Secretary of State, Whitehead made much diplomatic progress in the countries of Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria by meeting with state officials and building meaningful relationships with their representatives. In Poland for example, Whitehead traveled for approximately three weeks between January and February of 1987 to discuss issues related to economic sanctions. </p>

<p>Military communist leader, Wojciech Jaruzelski, had imposed martial law in Poland on December 13, 1981. As a result, the US began a systematic implementation of economic sanctions that would destroy the authoritarian government, and it was Whitehead who settled most of these negotiations. Whitehead reached an agreement with Jaruzelski to stop politically motivated arrests, and later convinced the Reagan Administration to lift the sanctions based on the settlement. This was a significant human rights victory resulting from a US foreign policy initiative,  and Whitehead provided the impetus that made it happen. </p>

<h7> Domestic Policies </h7>
<p>While at Washington, Whitehead also learned about the effects of having a collective identity as a representative figure of a political party. It was confusing and difficult to operate under the big umbrella of the US Government. Whitehead felt frustrated at times because he was trying to breach gaps between racial groups on the domestic front. Meanwhile, President Reagan’s pronouncements on South African apartheid sent a contradictory message regarding U.S. engagement with people of color abroad. During 1983, the system of apartheid that racially segregated people in South Africa was under attack by the international community, and economic sanctions were enacted in hopes of collapsing the system. Many disagree on whether or not this was the appropriate course of action, but it was the UN’s recommendation and President Reagan's choice to veto the sanctions consequently linked him to pro-apartheid ideals.</p>

<p>Regardless of the executive outlook, Whitehead continued to work on projects he felt passionate about, and in 1985 he submitted a proposal with 32 recommendations to Secretary Shultz that increased the opportunities for people of color in the Foreign Service. Whitehead recommended several options, like providing greater access to the Foreign Service exam in colleges and universities who had historically committed to the education of minority groups. He also suggested the assignment of more black officers to senior (and visible) role model positions in the government, as well as the inclusion of more people of color on the Board of Examiners Panels. President Reagan did recognize Whitehead’s commitment to these civil rights issues, and  in 1989, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award in the United States.</p> 

<p>Whitehead felt very passionate about his work in diplomacy, but he didn’t feel the need to continue to pursue other political positions in D.C. after Reagan's term. He had discovered other avenues for change and wanted to dedicate his full attention to nonprofit organizations that lacked federal financial support. The NGOs that he had helped establish were in desperate need of vocal allies, and Whitehead felt that his skill-sets would have greater impact and be better utilized in the private rather than public arena. 
 </p>

<p>Regardless of that, Whitehead continued to work on projects he felt passionate about and in 1985, he submitted a proposal with 32 recommendations for Shultz to increase the opportunities of black people in the Foreign Service. Some of Whitehead’s recommendations included targeting colleges and universities who had historically committed to the education of minority groups, and providing them with greater access to the specific information on how to apply for the Foreign Service exam. He also suggested the assignment of more black officers to senior (and visible) role model positions in the government, as well as the inclusion of more people of color on the Board of Examiners Panels.</p>

<p>President Reagan did recognize Whitehead’s commitment to these civil rights issues, and  in 1989, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal. This recognition is the second highest civilian award in the US,  and it is awarded to someone who has done significant work for citizens of the US. Whitehead felt very passionate about his work in diplomacy, but he didn’t feel the need to continue to pursue other political positions in D.C. after Reagan's term because he had discovered other avenues for change. He wanted to dedicate his full attention to nonprofit organizations that lacked federal financial support. The NGO’s and nonprofits Whitehead worked for were in desperate need of vocal allies, and he knew he could gather more support in a nonpartisan environment rather than in a political one.</p> 

<p>Whitehead’s public service role evolved greatly after the State Department. He transitioned from being Deputy Secretary of State during the Cold War and Reagan-Era, and he kept working with NGO’s and nonprofits (see Philanthropy section). Whitehead was again recruited for government service after the 9/11 attacks took place at the World Trade Center in New York. This event was evidently a grave shift in international foreign policy issues, and it affected and continues to impact the lives of people all over the world. After the attacks the people of lower Manhattan were physically unable to continue with their daily routines because of the high destruction levels in the area.</p> 

<p>There are current estimates that place the financial burden of 9/11 at an overwhelming three trillion dollars. Toll and physical damage alone estimated at around $55 billion of that total. Mayor-elect Michael Bloomberg and Governor George Pataki of New York focused on creating a system that would oversee transportation, construction, and other infrastructure projects, as well as keeping incentives for people to reside and do business throughout in the area. They devised the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) as the agent of that system, and Whitehead was selected as its leader.</p> 

<p>He had previously attempted to retire and similar opportunities had come up. Nevertheless, Whitehead became chairman at age 79 and he helped create programs that would maintain a significant residential and commercial presence in the area, including the affordable housing initiative and the community enhancement fund. Whitehead also helped open up schools in the area and even began the procedures for the construction of the memorial. He also arranged a ferry system for commuters from New Jersey who were struggling to get into the city due to the damaged railroad systems after the attacks. Whitehead’ age did not allow him to work on the project as comprehensively as he would have liked to, but he was a key figure who pioneered the program. Whitehead’s experiences in public service developed his altruistic character. He became resourceful and ambitious, and realized that if couldn’t help the government in assisting causes, he had to help pilot NGO’s that could. This is why philanthropy ultimately paved Whitehead's pathway through allyship, and this will be explored further in the following section.</p>
                                
<h8>September 11, 2001 & The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) </h8>
<p>Whitehead transitioned from being Deputy Secretary of State during the Cold War in the Reagan-Era to working almost completely with NGOs and nonprofits. The 9/11 attacks at the World Trade Center in New York greatly impacted U.S. foreign policy, and the repercussions continue to affect the lives of people all over the world today. Current estimates place the financial burden of America’s 9/11 response at an overwhelming three trillion dollars, with the toll of physical damage to New York alone estimated at $55 billion of that total. Mayor-elect Michael Bloomberg and Governor George Pataki of New York focused on creating a system that would oversee transportation, construction, and other infrastructure projects, while keeping incentives for people to reside and do business throughout the area. They devised the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) to better manage that system, and Whitehead was selected as its chairman at the age of 79.</p>

<p>He pioneered the LMDC program and helped create systems that would maintain a significant residential and commercial presence in lower Manhattan, including the affordable housing initiative and the community enhancement fund. Whitehead oversaw the renovations of the ferry system for commuters from New Jersey who were struggling to get into the city due to the damaged railroad systems. He also helped open up schools in the area and even began the procedures for the construction of the 9/11 memorial. Whitehead’s experiences in public service strengthened his altruistic character, and taught him how to prioritize projects and balance time. He became resourceful and ambitious, and realized that if he couldn’t help the government in assisting causes, he had to help pilot NGO’s that could. These lessons would inform his philanthropy, ultimately paving his way to what we term “allyship.”</p>
