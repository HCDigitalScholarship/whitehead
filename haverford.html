Before helping so many people and working across a number of fields and disciplines, Whitehead experienced financial setbacks and Quakerism at a young age. The son of Eugene Whitehead and Winifred Kaufmann, Whitehead was born on April 2nd, 1922 in Illinois, and was raised in Montclair, New Jersey. Whitehead was first exposed to the hardships of the economy at the age of seven, when the stock market crashed in 1929 and later developed into the Great Depression. Whitehead saw his father lose his job and his family struggle to make ends meet. Despite this, he searched for meaningful pastimes and got involved in his town’s local Boy Scouts chapter, where he learned a great deal about responsibility and working with and for others. Despite his financially unstable upbringing, Whitehead was filled with positive energy and he learned a lot about the value of hard work. </p>

<p>Whitehead became assistant camp director at his Camp Glen Gray in Oakland, and after Montclair, he completed his undergraduate education at Haverford College.
He enrolled in the fall of 1939 with an intended Chemistry major and ended up doing Economics, which was a good fit for his later work in naval accounting and then investment banking. Although Whitehead was a diligent academic, he excelled more in extracurricular activities and organizations. He sang in the glee club, played JV baseball and basketball, wrote for the college newspaper, was a high jumper on the track team, and worked at the library. In addition to playing sports, he also helped coordinate many by directing the Intramural Athletics Club. Whitehead was also a part of the International Relations Club and he presided over the Students’ Council during his senior year. His proudest achievement during college was being elected permanent class president during his senior year. His classmates thought Whitehead ought to be representative of a larger group, and he continued to work in this manner throughout his life.</p> 

<p>The outbreak of World War II in 1939 made Whitehead’s college experience somewhat different. He was in Haverford’s library, listening to the radio, when an interrupted report broadcasted the news of the surprise military attack on the Hawaiian US naval base of Pearl Harbor. It was then that Whitehead discovered patriotic feelings and a responsibility to serve in the war. The Navy’s Supply Corps plan was designed to allow students in higher education to graduate earlier from school to service the War. Instead of completing his undergraduate education in the expected four years, Whitehead and many of his classmates completed a summer semester and were able to graduate early in January of 1943. Whitehead attributed a lot of his successes to the college and he saw the experience as formative of his altruistic character. The liberal arts education also reminded Whitehead that he could have an interdisciplinary career that was not limited in its scope.</p> 

<p>John Whitehead loved helping people and making a difference, and he did both things until the very end. He passed away due to bladder cancer at the age of 92 on February 7, 2015.  Whitehead was a great man and an even greater leader. He truly cared about people, and as a result people cared about him and trusted his input. He also didn’t do the great things he did because he felt obligated to. Whitehead’s legacy is incredible because he did things he felt should be done. His work as an ally was ahead of his time and he had a progressive outlook that made him culturally aware, politically concerned, and financially able to help many who had nothing. John Whitehead spent a lifetime working to create more systems of cultural tolerance that would enable spheres for social change. It is now our responsibility to protect and further those systems under the existing political climate that threatens to reverse his and others’ sociopolitical progress. </p>
